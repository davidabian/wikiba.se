## FAQ

### What is the difference between Wikibase and Wikidata?

Wikibase is the name of the software that was originally written for, and is used by, the
[Wikidata project](https://www.wikidata.org/). Wikidata is the free knowledge base that
anyone can edit. Its data is used by Wikipedia, its sister projects and anyone else who wants to make use of a large amount of open general-purpose data.

### Where can I find the source code?

Wikibase consists of several components.

You can find an overview on the [applications page]({{site.url}}/applications).

### How can I easily set up my own Wikibase instance?

You can use our docker containers which are available on [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/wikibase/).

You can read the documentation on how to use these in the [wikibase-containers repository](https://github.com/wmde/wikibase-docker).
