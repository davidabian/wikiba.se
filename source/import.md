## Importing data to Wikibase

Perhaps the greatest challenge of a clean, empty database is that of properly filling it up with what you want to put in it.  Wikibase is no exception; this section covers the most common and useful tools for getting data into Wikibase.

### QuickStatements

[QuickStatements](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Help:QuickStatements) is the import tool you'll find already running in your Docker setup. The essential help document linked here is packed with information far too intricate to be summarized here, but it's worth noting that [OpenRefine](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Tools/OpenRefine) data [see below](#OpenRefine) can be exported to QuickStatements format.
