## Federation 

Lots of people are excited about federation in Wikibase, but federation means different things to different people. Below we lay out the different meanings of the term and show you what's currently available

### Federated querying

[Federated queries](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-federated-query/) is a property of SPARQL that allows your search to include multiple endpoints.

Federated querying is already implemented in Wikibase. You can see a partial, example list of federation endpoints used by Wikidata [here](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Wikidata_Query_Service/User_Manual/SPARQL_Federation_endpoints). 

The [Wikibase registry](https://wikibase-registry.wmflabs.org/wiki/Main_Page) also has some useful information.
