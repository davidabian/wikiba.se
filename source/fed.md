## Federation 

Lots of people are excited about federation in Wikibase, but federation means different things to different people. Here we'll show you the difference between types of federation and explain what's available today in Wikibase.

### Federated querying

[Federated queries](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-federated-query/) is a property of SPARQL that allows your search to include multiple endpoints.

Federated querying is absolutely implemented in Wikibase. You can see a partial, example list of federation endpoints used by Wikidata [here](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Wikidata_Query_Service/User_Manual/SPARQL_Federation_endpoints). 

The [Wikibase registry](https://wikibase-registry.wmflabs.org/wiki/Main_Page) also has some useful information.
