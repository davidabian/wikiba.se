### Know your local settings

You can add any number of extensions, templates and gadgets, and they vary widely both in popularity and in ease of installation. To use many of these add-ons, you'll need to make changes to the [LocalSettings.php](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:LocalSettings.php) file on your MediaWiki/Wikibase Docker instance (often `docker_wikibase_1`). 

Although this manual isn't meant to replace a grounding in Docker, the following commands may help you get at and edit this very important file:

#### Copy the file to your local directory
```
docker cp docker_wikibase_1:/var/www/html/LocalSettings.php LocalSettings.php
```
#### After editing the file on your local computer, copy it back
```
docker cp LocalSettings.php docker_wikibase_1:/var/www/html/LocalSettings.php 
```
